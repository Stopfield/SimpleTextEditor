# The Simple Text Editor
A simple text editor that reads input from STDIN, puts it in a buffer, and at the end of the program, writes the buffer to a file.
I even compiled a C program with it!

## How to use
Just run the program and write! Press any escape key to exit (that's a problem)

## Limitations
* The buffer is only 1024 bytes long. So no long texts.
* The arrow keys don't work

## This is just for learning purposes, it's not remotely possible to use this in real cases!
